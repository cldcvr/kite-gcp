# Kite Data Module

The Data Module is a collection of APIs that drastically simplify working with datasets
in the Hadoop filesystems (such as HDFS).

This project is part of the Kite project, an open source
set of APIs that helps developers more easily build robust systems and applications
with Apache Hadoop.

See the [online documentation](http://kitesdk.org/docs/current/) for
more information.
